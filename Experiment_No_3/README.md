Assignment Task
Question 1: GMM Clustering on 2D Data
Objective: Apply a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to a two-dimensional array to
perform soft clustering and visualize the learned decision boundaries.
Steps:
1. Data Generation: Generate a 2D array (X) with 300 points containing 3 distinct
”blobs” or clusters.
2. Fit and Predict: Fit a GMM with n components = 3 to the data. Predict the
cluster labels for each data point.
3. Visualization:
• Create a scatter plot of the data points, coloring them by their predicted
cluster label.
• Overlay contour lines (ellipses) to represent the shape, orientation, and
spread of the fitted Gaussian distributions.
• Mark the estimated centers (means) of each Gaussian component on the plot.
4. Analysis: Output the converged means and covariance matrices of the mixture
components.
