# Experiment 01: HAR using Wisdm dataset.
Lab Problem Statement: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using WISDM.

Problem Definition:

Develop a Deep Learning model to classify human physical activities based on tri-axial accelerometer data. You are provided with the WISDM (Wireless Sensor Data Mining) dataset, which contains accelerometer recordings from 36 users performing 6 distinct activities.

Objective:

Preprocess the raw time-series data using a Sliding Window technique (segmentation). Build a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or LSTM model to classify the activities. Evaluate the model's accuracy and visualize the Confusion Matrix. Target Activities: Walking, Jogging, Upstairs, Downstairs, Sitting, Standing.
Colab Implementation You can copy-paste the code below directly into a Google Colab cell. It includes a command to automatically download the dataset so you don't need to manually upload files.
